 # Water_Leakage_Detection Using Opencv

# What is Opencv?
OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. 
It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces.

# Library I have Used In This Program

1)Matplotlib\n
2)numpy\n
3)opencv\n
4)Keras Framework

using This Library I have detected Water leakage through Images.

In order to prevent serious damage being done through faulty pipes.It is essential to detect leakage before disaster hits.
